### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying the Back End Developer Elective in the Udacity Nanodegree.

**Today's Progress**: Got through to the 3rd lesson of the Back End Developer Elective. Going by this progress, should be able to finish it by tomorrow, if not, Sunday.

**Thoughts**: Learned about SQL selects, joins, and inserts.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
